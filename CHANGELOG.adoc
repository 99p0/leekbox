== 5.3.3-dev

* Require analyzer 5.2.0.
* Fix nice mocks generation in mixed mode (generated code is pre null-safety,
while mocked class is null-safe).
* Require Dart >= 2.17.0.

== 5.3.2

* Support analyzer 5.0.0.

== 5.3.1

* Fix analyzer and code_builder dependencies.
* Reference `@GenerateNiceMocks` in documentation.
* Allow generating a mock class which includes overriding members with private
types in their signature. Such members cannot be stubbed with mockito, and
will only be generated when specified in MockSpec `unsupportedMembers`.
* Include `required` keyword in functions used as default return values.
